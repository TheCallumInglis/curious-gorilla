# ![Express API - Pets Back-End](./assets/hero.png)

## About

In this module, students will practice the fundamental operations of creating, reading, updating, and deleting data (CRUD) using the Mongoose ODM library with Express. They will explore techniques for managing cross-origin resource sharing (CORS), allowing their APIs to safely interact with resources from various domains. Additionally, they will gain hands-on practice with Postman to test API functionality under different scenarios. By the end of this module, students will be equipped with the essential skills to develop and maintain a fully functional API in Express.

## Prerequisites

- RESTful Routing
- Intro to Express
- Postman Setup Lab
- MongoDB Atlas Setup Lab
