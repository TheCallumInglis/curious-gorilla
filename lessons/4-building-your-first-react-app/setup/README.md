# ![Building Your First React App - Setup](./assets/hero.png)

## Setup

Open your Terminal application and navigate to your `~/code/ga/lectures` directory:

```bash
cd ~/code/ga/lectures
```

Next, run the following:

```bash
npm create vite@latest
```

You'll be prompted to provide a project name. `vite-project` is the default but when you start typing that default will go away. Choose a name that makes sense for this project; in this case, we'll call the app `first-react-app`.

Next, you'll select a framework. Use the arrow keys to choose the `React` option, and hit `Enter`.

Again, use the arrow keys to choose the `JavaScript` variant and hit `Enter`.

Move into the project you just created and run `npm i` to install the dependencies:

```bash
cd first-react-app
npm i
```

Launch the app in VS Code:

```bash
code .
```

Open the `App.jsx` file in the `src` directory and replace the contents of it with the following:

```jsx
// src/App.jsx

const App = () => {

  return (
    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
  );
};

export default App;
```
