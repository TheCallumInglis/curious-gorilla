# ![Fetching Data in React - Fetching Data with User Input](./assets/hero.png)

**Learning objective:** By the end of this lesson, students will be able to make a `fetch` request to the weather API using dynamic data from user input.

## Overview

When we fetch data based on user actions, like submitting a form or clicking a link, we often need to include additional information within our fetch request. With a link, this additional information might be a unique identifier for a given resource. With a search bar, we would need to include the search term. In this lesson, we focus on building out a feature that allows users to search for weather information by entering a city name in a search bar. We'll build out a search component to take in user input, fetch the weather data, store it in state, and then display it to the user in a dedicated component.

## Building the search form component

Let's start out by building the search component. With this component, a user should be able to enter in the name of a city, and submit the form.

Run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
mkdir src/components
touch src/components/WeatherSearch.jsx
```

Add the following to `src/components/WeatherSearch.jsx`:

```jsx
// src/components/WeatherSearch.jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

const WeatherSearch = (props) => {
  const [city, setCity] = useState('');

  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    // We'll call the fetch function here
    setCity('');
  };

  return (
    <section>
      <h2>Search</h2>
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <label htmlFor="city">Enter a city:</label>
        <input
          id="city"
          type="text"
          value={city}
          onChange={(e) => setCity(e.target.value)}
        />
        <button type="submit">Search</button>
      </form>
    </section>
  );
};

export default WeatherSearch;
```

Next, we'll need to display the `WeatherSearch` component.

Add the following import at the top of `src/App.jsx`:

```jsx
// src/App.jsx
import WeatherSearch from './components/WeatherSearch';
```

Update the `return` in `src/App.jsx` with the following:

```jsx
// src/App.jsx
return (
  <main>
    <h1>Weather API</h1>
    <WeatherSearch />
  </main>
);
```

In your browser, you should now be able to type information into the search field and see it added to state.

## Submitting a search

With our search form in place, we can now build out the remaining functionality. When a user submits a request for weather information, we'll want to store the response data in `weather` state.

Add the following import to the top of `src/App.jsx`:

```jsx
// src/App.jsx
import { useState } from 'react';
```

And define the following `useState`:

```jsx
// src/App.jsx
const [weather, setWeather] = useState({});
```

Next we'll need to make a few changes to our `fetchData` function.

Our `fetchData` function will need to accept a `city` string as an argument, and `setWeather` state based on the `data` we get as a response.

The information we get back from the Weather API is quite detailed, but the data structure used in these responses is not ideal for rendering. In a situation like this, it's often a good idea to clean up the shape of the data before setting it in state.

There are three pieces of information we want to display for our users:

1. The name of the location
2. The current temperature of the location
3. The current weather condition for that location

Given that, we can create a new object like the one below, and set that to state:

```js
const newWeatherState = {
  location: data.location.name,
  temperature: data.current.temp_f,
  condition: data.current.condition.text,
};
```

Refactor your `fetchData` function as shown below:

```jsx
// src/App.jsx
const fetchData = async (city) => {
  const data = await weatherService.show(city);
  const newWeatherState = {
    location: data.location.name,
    temperature: data.current.temp_f,
    condition: data.current.condition.text,
  };
  setWeather(newWeatherState);
};
// The following log should be outside of the fetchData function
console.log('State:', weather);
```

> 💡 Why aren't we logging `weather` within `fetchData`? This is due to the asynchronous nature of state updates. If we tried to log state within the function, we would see an out of date record of state. By logging it outside the function, but within the component, we can see the current value held in state when the component rerenders.

In order to lift state back to `App`, we'll need to pass our `fetchData` function down into our `WeatherSearch` component.

Pass `fetchData` down to `<WeatherSearch />` as a prop:

```jsx
// src/App.jsx
<WeatherSearch fetchData={fetchData} />
```

And update `handleSubmit` with the following:

```jsx
// src/components/WeatherSearch.jsx
const handleSubmit = (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  props.fetchData(city); // Don't forget to pass city state!
  setCity('');
};
```

Check your browser console or React Dev Tools. You should see weather information is now held in `weather` state!

## Displaying weather details

With state being updated correctly, its time to render this data for our users. We'll accomplish this in a dedicated component called `WeatherDetails`.

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
touch src/components/WeatherDetails.jsx
```

Let's build out a basic HTML structure for the component.

Add the following to `src/components/WeatherDetails.jsx`:

```jsx
// src/components/WeatherDetails.jsx
const WeatherDetails = (props) => {
  console.log('WeatherDetails props:', props);
  return (
    <section>
      <h2>Weather Details</h2>
      <p>Location:</p>
      <p>Temperature:</p>
      <p>Condition:</p>
    </section>
  );
};

export default WeatherDetails;
```

Add the following import to `src/App.jsx`:

```jsx
// src/App.jsx
import WeatherDetails from './components/WeatherDetails';
```

Next, add `<WeatherDetails />` to the `return` with `weather` included as a prop:

```jsx
// src/App.jsx

return (
  <main>
    <h1>Weather API</h1>
    <WeatherSearch />
    <WeatherDetails weather={weather} />
  </main>
);
```

Confirm that `weather` has been passed down through props.

Finally, update the `return` in `src/components/WeatherDetails.jsx` with the following:

```jsx
// src/components/WeatherDetails.jsx
return (
  <section>
    <h2>Weather Details</h2>
    <p>Location: {props.weather.location}</p>
    <p>Temperature: {props.weather.temperature}</p>
    <p>Condition: {props.weather.condition}</p>
  </section>
);
```

You should now be able to view the result of a search. Try it out in your browser!
